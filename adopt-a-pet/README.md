# ðŸ”¨ ExpressJS â€“ Adopt A Pet
<p>Imagine you are looking to add a new furry friend to your family! On the pet adoption website, you browse through the categories of animals and select the one youâ€™re interested in, which brings you to another page that contains a list of available pets. Then, you continue your search by further clicking on an individual pet to view its profile page.</p> 
<p>Every time you navigate to a different webpage, your browser is making a request to the web server. Thanks to routing, the server knows exactly which endpoint should handle the request and can return the correct HTML page to display.</p>
<p>In this project, youâ€™ll use the Express framework to create a simple pet adoption site that contains multiple routes.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s get started!</p>

<h2>Set up the Express app</h2>
<p>1. Via NPM, install Express by doing in the terminal: <code>npm install express</code></p>
<p>Then create a file app.js, and import express from the express module as the following <i>Hello World</i>from the documentation.</p>
<p>2. Create an instance of the express module, and save the object to a variable called app.</p>
<h2>Create the index route</h2>
<p>3. To create the first route /, first define a function called app.get() on the route /, that returns an HTML <code> h1 </code> element with the text Adopt a Pet!. Remember that HTML can be returned as a Template string  with the function res.send().</p>
<p>4. Use the <code>app.listen()</code> function with the port of your choice (by convention we use the port 3000)</p>
<p>Run your code now and go on http://localhost:3000, you should see the heading displayed on the page!</p>
<p>5. Letâ€™s add some more elements to the page. Right after the <code> h1 </code> element, add a <p> element that contains the text <b>Browse through the links below to find your new furry friend:</b>.</p>
<p>6. Now after the <p> element, create an unordered list using <ul>. The bulleted list should contain three items: Dogs, Cats, and Rabbits. Remember to use <li> to create each item.</p>
<h2>Create the animalsâ€™ route</h2>
<p>7. The site is looking good so far! The next step is to create individual pages for each animal type and link them in the bulleted list. To do that, weâ€™ll add a new /animals route.</p>
<p>In the <code>res.send()</code>, create a string containing an <code> h1 </code> element with the text List of pets</p>
<p>8. Create a new route with <code>app.get()</code> with the URL pattern â€˜/animals/Xâ€™, where X is a variable section of the URL. Name the variable part :pet_type.</p>
<p>9. Next, take the parameter called :pet_type and modify the <code> h1 </code> heading to read List of X, where X is :pet_type with the object req.param.</p>
<p>10. Weâ€™re ready to create links on the index page that links to each individual animal page! Inside the / route, turn each bulleted list item into a link by adding an<code> a </code> element within each <code>li</code> element:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dogs should link to <code>â€˜/animals/dogsâ€™</code></li>
    <li>Cats should link to <code>â€˜/animals/catsâ€™</code></li>
    <li>Rabbits should link to <code>â€˜/animals/rabbitsâ€™</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now run your code and try clicking on the links!</p>
D/ Populate page content
Now create a new file <code> helper.js</code>. This file will contain an object named pets that contains some data that we can use to populate the webpages.
``` const pets = {
   'dogs': [
       {
           'name': 'Spot',
           'age': 2,
           'breed': 'Dalmatian',
           'description': 'Spot is an energetic puppy who seeks fun and adventure!',
           'url': 'https://robohash.org/eaqueatquecommodi.png?size=50x50&set=set1'
       },
       {
           'name': 'Shadow',
           'age': 4,
           'breed': 'Border Collie',
           'description': 'Eager and curious, Shadow enjoys company and can always be found tagging along at your heels!',
           'url': 'https://robohash.org/etidnatus.png?size=50x50&set=set1'
       }
   ],
   'cats': [
       {
           'name': 'Snowflake',
           'age': 1,
           'breed': 'Tabby',
           'description': 'Snowflake is a playful kitten who loves roaming the house and exploring.',
           'url': 'https://robohash.org/quaevoluptatibusconsequatur.png?size=50x50&set=set1'
       }
   ],
   'rabbits': [
       {
           'name': 'Easter',
           'age': 4,
           'breed': 'Mini Rex',
           'description': 'Easter is a sweet, gentle rabbit who likes spending most of the day sleeping.',
           'url': 'https://robohash.org/numquamvelalias.png?size=50x50&set=set1'
       }
   ]
}
module.exports = pets;
```

The pets object contains three elements, one for each animal type. The key is the animal type and the value is a list of objects, each of which contains info about an individual pet.

Start by importing the pets object at the top of app.js.

Inside the /animals route, youâ€™ll be modifying the html you send back to display the names of all available pets that are of :pet_type.
Right before the res.send(), create a for loop that iterates over each element in the list of pets. You can access the appropriate list of pets in the pets object by the key, pet_type. Inside the loop, create a <li> element for each petâ€™s name and concatenate the string to a variable named html.
Then, make sure to concatenate the opening <code> ul </code> tag to html before the loop and the closing <code> ul </code> tag after the loop, such that the <code> li </code> elements would be nested inside the <code> ul </code> element.
If you run your code and navigate to each animal page, you can see a bulleted list of available pets!
E/ Create the pet route
The next step is to create and link to individual profile pages for each pet. To do that, weâ€™ll add a new pet route. Define a route that is associated with the URL pattern '/animals/X/#', where X and # are variable sections of the URL. The section indicated by X should be called :pet_type and the section indicated by # should be called :pet_id.

In the body, create a variable called pet that stores the profile information of the pet who is of pet_type and has index position pet_id in its list of pets.

In other words, first access the appropriate list of pets in the pets object by the key, pet_type. Then, access the appropriate object in the list of pets by the index position, pet_id.
Your resulting pet dictionary will look like this:
{
  'name': ...,
  'age': ...,
  'breed': ...,
  'description': ...,
  'url': ...
}
Return an HTML <code> h1 </code> element containing the petâ€™s name. You can access the petâ€™s name from the pet dictionary you created in the previous step.

Now, weâ€™re ready to create links on the animal page that links to each individual pet profile page! Inside the /animals route, turn each bulleted list item into a link by adding an <code> a </code> element within each <code> li </code> element.

The URL we want to link to should follow the pattern '/animals/X/#', where X is pet_type and # is the index position.
Once youâ€™re done, run your code and try navigating to an individual petâ€™s profile page.
Finally, letâ€™s add some more content to the profile page! Inside the /pet route, right after the <code> h1 </code>element, add the following elements to display the profile info stored in the pet dictionary:
<code> img </code> to display the photo at the given URL
<code> p </code> that contains the petâ€™s description
<code> ul </code> with two <code> li </code> for the petâ€™s breed and age
