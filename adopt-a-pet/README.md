# ðŸ”¨ ExpressJS â€“ Adopt A Pet
<p>Imagine you are looking to add a new furry friend to your family! On the pet adoption website, you browse through the categories of animals and select the one youâ€™re interested in, which brings you to another page that contains a list of available pets. Then, you continue your search by further clicking on an individual pet to view its profile page.</p> 
<p>Every time you navigate to a different webpage, your browser is making a request to the web server. Thanks to routing, the server knows exactly which endpoint should handle the request and can return the correct HTML page to display.</p>
<p>In this project, youâ€™ll use the Express framework to create a simple pet adoption site that contains multiple routes.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s get started!</p>

<h2>Set up the Express app</h2>
<p>1. Via NPM, install Express by doing in the terminal: <code>npm install express</code></p>
<p>Then create a file app.js, and import express from the express module as the following <i>Hello World</i>from the documentation.</p>
<p>2. Create an instance of the express module, and save the object to a variable called app.</p>
<h2>Create the index route</h2>
<p>3. To create the first route /, first define a function called app.get() on the route /, that returns an HTML <h1> element with the text Adopt a Pet!. Remember that HTML can be returned as a Template string  with the function res.send().</p>
<p>4. Use the <code>app.listen()</code> function with the port of your choice (by convention we use the port 3000)</p>
<p>Run your code now and go on http://localhost:3000, you should see the heading displayed on the page!</p>
<p>5. Letâ€™s add some more elements to the page. Right after the <h1> element, add a <p> element that contains the text <b>Browse through the links below to find your new furry friend:</b>.</p>
<p>6. Now after the <p> element, create an unordered list using <ul>. The bulleted list should contain three items: Dogs, Cats, and Rabbits. Remember to use <li> to create each item.</p>
<h2>Create the animalsâ€™ route</h2>
<p>7. The site is looking good so far! The next step is to create individual pages for each animal type and link them in the bulleted list. To do that, weâ€™ll add a new /animals route.</p>
<p>In the <code>res.send()</code>, create a string containing an <h1> element with the text List of pets</p>
<p>8. Create a new route with <code>app.get()</code> with the URL pattern â€˜/animals/Xâ€™, where X is a variable section of the URL. Name the variable part :pet_type.</p>
<p>9. Next, take the parameter called :pet_type and modify the <h1> heading to read List of X, where X is :pet_type with the object req.param.</p>
<p>10. Weâ€™re ready to create links on the index page that links to each individual animal page! Inside the / route, turn each bulleted list item into a link by adding an<code> <a> </code> element within each <code><li></code> element:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dogs should link to â€˜/animals/dogsâ€™</li>
    <li>Cats should link to â€˜/animals/catsâ€™</li>
    <li>Rabbits should link to â€˜/animals/rabbitsâ€™</li>
</ul>
<p>Now run your code and try clicking on the links!</p>
